                    <p>A letter from Management:</p>
                    <p>Congratulations, [NEW DWARVEN EMPLOYEE]! By signing up with DEEP ROCK GALACTIC, you have just taken your first step towards becoming an essential gear in the machine of the MOST TENACIOUS space mining corporation in the known galaxy!</p>
                    <p>At DEEP ROCK GALACTIC, we pride ourselves on having established practical dominance of some the most lucrative systems in the OUTER RIM. While our foolish and cowardly competitors generally regard these as too volatile or high-risk, DEEP ROCK GALACTIC calls them home.</p>
                    <p>At this time, we have a total of 89 ORBITAL SPACE RIGS in operation throughout MORE THAN A DOZEN Outer Rim systems, with 16 MORE currently under construction.</p>
                    <p>However, a NEW MANDATE is upon us! While our digs number in the dozens already, we are currently engaged in our most daring and heavily orchestrated mining operation to date: The COMPLETE SUBJUGATION of the planet HOXXES IV. </p>
                    <p>HOXXES IV constitutes, to the best of our knowledge, the SINGLE MOST LUCRATIVE mining location in the galaxy, containing the RICHEST AND MOST DENSE concentrations of valuable minerals we have ever encountered. However, it also just happens to be the SINGLE MOST HOSTILE place we have ever mapped. Several competitors before us have tried to tame Hoxxes IV, WITHOUT LUCK.</p>
                    <p>DEEP ROCK GALACTIC will succeed. DEEP ROCK GALACTIC is not in the business of failing.</p>
                    <p>MANAGEMENT BIDS YOU WELCOME, NEW MINER. WELCOME ABOARD.</p>

                    <p>Hoxxes IV is SO RICH IN MINERALS that our database of exploitable cave systems practically doubles on a weekly basis! But, thanks to the TIRELESS EFFORTS of the Research & Development branch, so too does our understanding of the extremely hostile flora and fauna found there. To prepare you for some of the risks that you’ll be facing on the planet, we have prepared a SMALL BRIEFING - we advise you to read it closely.
                    <img src="Scout.png"></p>
                    <h2>WHY DWARVES?</h2>
                    <p>While the operations of DEEP ROCK GALACTIC goes all across the spectrum when it comes to operating specs, there are some that absolutely stand out. And when it comes to the MOST DANGEROUS DIGS, we have long relied on the tenacity, strength, and sheer underground survivability of the stout DWARVES. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    It is a simple fact of life - when you're attempting to establish a profitable mining operation on the most hostile planet in the galaxy, sometimes things don’t go to plan. 
                    And when all other measures have failed - a mine suddenly gone dark, or a particularly heavy alien infestation is uncovered - that is when we send in the DWARVES. 
                    </p>
                    <h2>THE MOST DANGEROUS PLANET IN THE GALAXY?</h2>
                    <p>This is not hyperbole. DEEP ROCK GALACTIC has had their eyes on this awful rock for a long time, because it is so unreasonably rich in valuable and rare materials. The problem, however, is that it is also the home of one of the most dense and diverse collections of hostile alien flora and fauna ever encountered. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    It is an ugly planet. A bug planet. A planet of  plutonium-fanged worms that would like nothing better than to take up residence in your sinus cavities.
                    <br>
                    <br> 
                    What we are saying is this: Hoxxes IV is a very bad place.
                    </p>
                    <h2>SO HOW ARE YOU MEANT TO SURVIVE DOWN THERE?</h2>
                    <p>Let it never be said that DEEP ROCK GALACTIC spares any expense on equipment! Our Dwarven miners are consistently decked out with the heaviest, most reliable weapons, and the most advanced and ingenious gadgets this side of Rigel VII, and we are proud of this fact. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    From industrial flamethrowers, to experimental plasma chargers, to launchers firing climbable concrete platforms into walls - if the lads in R&D can dream it up, the Dwarves will have access to it!
